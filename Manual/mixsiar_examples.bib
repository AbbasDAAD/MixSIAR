abstract = {The Bayesian linear mixing model SISUS is used to reconstruct reliance on maize and intake of animal protein from the stable carbon (??13C) and nitrogen (??15N) isotope values of 149 directly dated Basketmaker II burials. Maize is the primary dietary staple. ??13C values are also enriched by intake of yucca and wild C4 plant foods but these resources are of minor importance in sampled diets. Animal protein intake is low and cottontail rabbits make the greatest contribution to female diets. Adolescent diets are indistinguishable from the diets of adult females and both groups are less reliant on artiodactyls than males. The ??13C and ??18O values of bone hydroxyapatite distinguish nursing infants and oxygen isotope values identify outsider adults relative to those local to the region where their deaths occurred. Most Utah Basketmaker II burials are contemporary with Black Mesa Lolomai phase occupations, postdating the Marsh Pass, AZ, White Dog phase. All burials in both studies were recovered from sheltered rather than open sites and reliance on maize does not increase over the temporal span of the Utah study, covering the two sigma range 415BC-AD322. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are commonly used to track resource flows through lake food webs. However, there remains a weak understanding of the spatial variation in isotopic composition of benthic resources and how this variation affects inference about energy flows among species. Boundary layers at the interface between benthic substrates and the overlying water column restrict diffusion of nutrients and carbon from the water column to benthic algae and may affect the isotopic composition of benthic algae as nutrient and CO2 concentrations can become locally depleted in the benthic boundary layer. We quantified the variation in C and N stable isotope composition of benthic resources along a depth gradient in a large oligotrophic lake to assess the magnitude of change in stable isotope composition. Snails were increasingly depleted in 13C with depth, by about 10 ‰ from 0 to 20 m, while 15N in snails showed only subtle enrichment over this depth range. Sculpin (Cottas aleuticus) $\delta$ 13C and $\delta$ 15N signatures did not significantly change with depth and were more enriched in 15N than would be expected from consumption of snails alone. A comparison of $\delta$ 13C and $\delta$ 15N values from sculpins relative to shallow and deep snails, and alternative prey (marine-derived salmon resources), within a mixing model suggested sculpins feed selectively on deep grazers in this system in addition to marine-derived resources provided by migrating sockeye salmon. This study illustrates the importance of accounting for depth-related variation in isotope patterns when assessing benthic resource contributions to food webs using stable isotope data.},

abstract = {The exceptional fossil sites of Cerro de los Batallones (Madrid Basin, Spain) contain abundant remains of Late Miocene mammals. From these fossil assemblages, we have inferred diet, resource partitioning and habitat of three sympatric carnivorous mammals based on stable isotopes. The carnivorans include three apex predators: two sabre-toothed cats (Felidae) and a bear dog (Amphicyonidae). Herbivore and carnivore carbon isotope ($\delta$13C) values from tooth enamel imply the presence of a woodland ecosystem dominated by C3 plants. $\delta$13C values and mixing-model analyses suggest that the two sabre-toothed cats, one the size of a leopard and the other the size of a tiger, consumed herbivores with similar $\delta$13C values from a more wooded portion of the ecosystem. The two sabre-toothed cats probably hunted prey of different body sizes, and the smaller species could have used tree cover to avoid encounters with the larger felid. For the bear dog, $\delta$13C values are higher and differ significantly from those of the sabre-toothed cats, suggesting a diet that includes prey from more open woodland. Coexistence of the sabre-toothed cats and the bear dog was likely facilitated by prey capture in different portions of the habitat. This study demonstrates the utility of stable isotope analysis for investigating the behaviour and ecology of members of past carnivoran guilds.},

abstract = { Purpose  Sediment fingerprinting with elemental tracers is widely used to identify sources of sediment to rivers. However, due to the need to isolate large amounts of suspended sediment, this approach can be difficult to implement in remote locations, such as the Mara River in Kenya, where high (and increasing) sediment loads are of concern. Materials and methods  We report several innovations that allowed us to carry out sediment fingerprinting in a portion (>6,500 km2) of the Mara River Basin. First, we utilized sediment-laden filters (sediment mass ∼0.1 g) for our river samples, rather than the traditional approach of extracting >1 g of sediment from large volumes of water. This allowed us to easily collect flow-weighted samples, and to process and analyze samples without access to centrifugation equipment. We carried out extensive quality control tests to ensure that we could reproducibly measure elemental concentrations of sediment trapped on filters. Second, we modified a readily available Bayesian inference mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) to create source signatures and to apportion downstream samples to sources. Third, we included hippo feces as a potential source, given the critical role that large wildlife plays in this ecosystem. Results and discussion  We found that: (1) sediment captured by filtration can be digested and analyzed reproducibly and used in sediment fingerprinting; (2) our four sources (three geographic categories and hippo feces) were reasonably well-separated in their signatures; (3) the three sub-basins all contributed substantially to sediment loading in the Mara; and (4) hippo feces contributed a small, but measurable, proportion of sediment in this system. Conclusions  Sediment-laden filters can be used successfully in identifying sediment sources through fingerprinting. The modified method of sediment fingerprinting should prove useful in other remote river basins. Our results support the hypothesis that the Upper Mara is important in supplying sediments to the river, while also highlighting the Talek sub-basin as a major contributor.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns due to their position at the interface between land and sea. This is particularly the case of temperate ecosystems where exploitation of coastal resources (fisheries and aquaculture) and intensive agricultural use of watersheds further complicate our understanding of their dynamics. The aim of the present study was to unravel the spatio-temporal dynamics of contrasted megatidal coastal ecosystems located at the same regional scale (i.e. under the same regional climate), but under different kinds of human pressure. Two kinds of ecological indicators were assessed over a period of four years at 11 locations along the coast of the Cotentin peninsula (Normandy, France). A first set of hydrobiological variables (dissolved nutrients, Chl a, temperature, salinity, etc.) was measured fortnightly in the water column. These data were analysed by principal components analysis (PCA). A second set of variables were the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of the adductor muscles of cultured Crassostrea gigas introduced every year to typify the bentho-pelagic coupling at each location. Food sources were also investigated using a mixing model with data on the isotopic composition of the food sources obtained previously. To identify which environmental variables played a significant role in determining the oyster diet, the contributions of oyster food sources were combined with environmental variables in a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Isotopic values of adductor muscles varied significantly between -20.12‰ and -16.79‰ for $\delta$ 13C and between 8.28‰ and 11.87‰ for $\delta$ 15N. The PCA distinguished two groups of coastal ecosystems that differed in their coastal hydrology, nutrient inputs, and the size of their respective watershed, irrespective of the year. In each zone, different spatial patterns in the measured variables were observed depending on the year showing that local impacts differed temporally. As revealed by CCA, food sources used by the oysters were mainly explained by salinity suggesting regional differences between ecosystems. On the west coast of the peninsula, climatic factors act in synergy with anthropogenic factors (i.e. nutrient enrichment) whereas on the east coast, climatic factors appear to be dampened by anthropogenic factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prey subsidies originating from detritus add nutrients and energy to arboreal communities. Measurement of this subsidy is required in the understanding of how food web dynamics respond to changes in surrounding environments. Shrub spiders are one of the key predators involved in food web coupling. We evaluate the effects of potential changes in prey availabilities during secondary succession on the contribution of subsidy from detrital food webs to shrub spiders and how different spider feeding guilds used the subsidy of prey from detrital food webs. We measured the relative importance of the subsidy for the spider feeding guilds, using the ratios of stable isotopes of C ($\delta$(13)C), and N ($\delta$(15)N) and C isotope discrimination ($\Delta$(14)C). Diet age was calculated from $\Delta$(14)C values, because old diet ages of spiders indicate that the spiders consume prey from detrital food sources. Dominant aerial prey (Diptera) had a distinctively old diet age compared with arboreal prey, which indicates that aerial prey were subsidized from detrital food webs. Sit-and-wait spiders tended to have an older diet age than active hunting spiders, which indicates that sit-and-wait spiders depended more on subsidies. Diet age varied only slightly for spiders in stands of different ages, indicating that rates at which spiders use grazing and detrital prey are probably determined more by foraging strategies and not by stand age. A dominance of sit-and-wait predators will lead to higher detrital subsidy inputs in shrub habitats. This study highlights the effect of shrub spider community structure (feeding guild composition) on the volume of the subsidy received from the detrital food web.},

abstract = {Ecosystem respiration (Reco ) is one of the largest terrestrial carbon (C) fluxes. The effect of climate change on Reco depends on the responses of its autotrophic and heterotrophic components. How autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration sources respond to climate change is especially important in ecosystems underlain by permafrost. Permafrost ecosystems contain vast stores of soil C (1672 Pg) and are located in northern latitudes where climate change is accelerated. Warming will cause a positive feedback to climate change if heterotrophic respiration increases without corresponding increases in primary production. We quantified the response of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration to permafrost thaw across the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. We partitioned Reco using $\Delta$(14) C and $\delta$(13) C into four sources-two autotrophic (above - and belowground plant structures) and two heterotrophic (young and old soil). We sampled the $\Delta$(14) C and $\delta$(13) C of sources using incubations and the $\Delta$(14) C and $\delta$(13) C of Reco using field measurements. We then used a Bayesian mixing model to solve for the most likely contributions of each source to Reco . Autotrophic respiration ranged from 40 to 70\% of Reco and was greatest at the height of the growing season. Old soil heterotrophic respiration ranged from 6 to 18\% of Reco and was greatest where permafrost thaw was deepest. Overall, growing season fluxes of autotrophic and old soil heterotrophic respiration increased as permafrost thaw deepened. Areas with greater thaw also had the greatest primary production. Warming in permafrost ecosystems therefore leads to increased plant and old soil respiration that is initially compensated by increased net primary productivity. However, barring large shifts in plant community composition, future increases in old soil respiration will likely outpace productivity, resulting in a positive feedback to climate change.},

abstract = {1. Individual variability in prey preferences can have marked effects on many demographic parameters from individual survival and fecundity to the vital rates of entire populations. A population level response is ultimately determined by individual prey choices; however, the effect of individual dietary choice is often overlooked. 2. We determined prey choice by individual consumers, light-bellied Brent geese Branta bernicla, during the overwintering period. Two hundred and eighty-one individuals were sampled at distinct temporal points over two winters. Stable isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen for blood cells and blood plasma, from each sampled individual were measured. Isotopic ratios for potential prey items were also measured. 3. Delta15N and delta13C for blood samples were both significantly different between sample months. Generally we found a decrease in both isotopic ratios during the course of the winter. All potential prey items were also isotopically distinct. Multisource mixing models (isosource) were used to determine the range of possible contribution to the diet of individuals. 4. During early winter, diet consisted almost exclusively of sea grass Zostera spp. The level of Zostera spp. in the diet dropped until mid-winter, and was supplemented by the utilization of green algae Ulva lactuca, and Enteromorpha spp., and terrestrial grasses. Terrestrial grass comprised an increasing proportion of the diet in late winter, representing virtually the exclusive food source by April. 5. By examining intrapopulation variability in resource utilization we highlight a number of ecologically important factors not addressed by previous population level studies.},

Intra-population variability in resource use may occur across hierarchical levels of population structure from individuals to subpopulations. Understanding how levels of population organization contribute to population niche width is critical to ecology and evolution. Here we describe a hierarchical stable isotope mixing model that can simultaneously estimate both the prey composition of a consumer diet and the diet variability among individuals and across levels of population organization. By explicitly estimating variance components for multiple scales, the model can deconstruct the niche width of a consumer population into relevant levels of population structure. We apply this new approach to stable isotope data from a population of gray wolves from coastal British Columbia, and show support for extensive intra-population niche variability among individuals, social groups, and geographically isolated subpopulations. The analytic method we describe improves mixing models by accounting for diet variability, and improves isotope niche width analysis by quantitatively assessing the contribution of levels of organization to the niche width of a population.},

However, carbonate ingestion and variable metabolic rates complicate these relationships. We evaluate if live-collected snails from Lanzarote (Canary Islands) reflect the abundance of C3 and CAM plants. Snails were collected on either CAM or C3 plants for isotope analysis of shell and body, and shell size. Respective shell and body $\delta$13C values of snails collected on CAM plants averaged − 8.5 ± 1.7‰ and − 22.8 ± 1.6‰, whereas specimens from C3 plants averaged − 10.1 ± 0.7‰ and − 24.9 ± 1.1‰. A flux balance model suggests snails experienced comparable metabolic rates. A two-source mass balance equation implies that snails consumed \~{} 10\% of CAM, which agrees with their abundance in the landscape. Snails collected on CAM plant were smaller than those on C3 plants. Conclusively: 1) snails consume CAM plants when they are available; 2) migration of snails among C3 and CAM plants is a common phenomenon; and 3) C3 plants may be a more energetic food for growth than CAM plants. This study shows that shell $\delta$13C values offer approximate estimates of plants in C3–CAM mixed environments.},
