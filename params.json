{"name":"MixSIAR","tagline":"A graphical user interface (GUI) for MixSIAR, a customizable Bayesian stable isotope mixing model","body":"MixSIAR GUI\r\n=============\r\n\r\nMixSIAR GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to analyze stable isotope data using the MixSIAR model framework. MixSIAR is a Bayesian mixing model that uses stable isotope data to estimate the proportions of source (prey) contributions to a mixture (consumer).\r\n\r\nMixSIAR represents a collaborative coding project between the investigators behind MixSIR and SIAR: Brice Semmens, Brian Stock, Eric Ward, Andrew Parnell, Donald Phillips, Andrew Jackson, Jon Moore, Stuart Bearhop, and Richard Inger.\r\n\r\nThe MixSIAR GUI incorporates several years of advances in Bayesian mixing model theory since MixSIR and SIAR, currently:\r\n\r\n- Any number of isotope/tracer values (usually 1, 2, or 3, but tested up to 20)\r\n- Source fitting (both for raw source data and means+SD data)\r\n- Hierarchical random/fixed effects (up to 2, either hierarchical/nested or not)\r\n- Continuous covariates (up to 1, theoretically any number)\r\n- Option to include Individual random effects\r\n- Error structure options: residual error (SIAR) or not (MixSIR)\r\n- Concentration dependence\r\n\r\n### TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL:\r\n\r\nJust above the blue bar, there is a row with \"commits\", \"branches\", \"releases\", and \"contributors\". Click on **\"releases\"** and you should see the latest version. Below the release notes, click on the \"Source code (zip)\" button to download the release. The current user manual will be in the .zip folder with installation instructions and a walk-through of MixSIAR via several example datasets.\r\n\r\n### FEEDBACK PLEASE!\r\n\r\nThis software has been improved by the questions, suggestions, and bug reports of the user community. If you have a comment, ideally use the _issues_ (exclamation point in a circle) tab on the right hand side of this page. You can also post to the [SIAR facebook group] or shoot me an email (_b1stock@ucsd.edu_).\r\n\r\n### ON CITING MixSIAR:\r\n\r\nIf you use MixSIAR GUI results in publications, please cite the MixSIAR GUI manual as (similar to how you cite R):\r\n\r\n>B.
