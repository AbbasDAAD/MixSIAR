MixSIAR GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to analyze stable isotope data using the MixSIAR model framework. MixSIAR is a Bayesian mixing model that uses stable isotope data to estimate the proportions of source (prey) contributions to a mixture (consumer).

MixSIAR represents a collaborative coding project between the investigators behind MixSIR and SIAR: Brice Semmens, Brian Stock, Eric Ward, Andrew Parnell, Donald Phillips, Andrew Jackson, Jon Moore, Stuart Bearhop, and Richard Inger.

The MixSIAR GUI incorporates several years of advances in Bayesian mixing model theory since MixSIR and SIAR, currently:

- Any number of isotope values (tested with 1, 2, or 3)
- Source fitting (both for raw source data and means+SD data)
- Categorical covariates (up to 2, modeled as random effects, either nested or non-nested)
- Continuous covariates (up to 1, theoretically any number)
- Option to include Individual effects (as random effect)
- Error structure options (residual, combined source, or both--default)
- Concentration dependence
